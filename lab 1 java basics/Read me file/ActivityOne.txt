	Printed 1st program in java and found the following errors.


	error 1: When changed the class name:
			When I changed the name of class the file name was the same as that of previous, so the error occured,
		Therefore file name should be same as that of class name.
	error 2: Removing of one bracket.
			When removed bracket it showed compiler error, so that without matched pair of braces it can not run
	error 3: writing smaller "s" for start of print statement:
			It shows compiler error, as java as case sensitive therefore we can not change the names of functions on our desire.
	error 4: Removing semicolon
			When we remove even semicolon it shows compilation error, that output function should be given semicolon at the end.
