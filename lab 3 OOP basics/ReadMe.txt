	ActivityOne:	The correct source files are uploaded.
	
	~Errors in class Test1:
		 As there is no constructor with arguments so remove 5 in creating object "t1".

	~Errors in class Test2:
		 Calls the undefined argument. x() , correction: define it or remove.
	
	~Errors in class Test3:
		Can not print the statement in other method without main method.

	~Errors in class Test4:
		No constructor with parameters defined, so remove 5.0 in parameters in creating the class. And define class C in
		new file.
	
	~Errors in class Test5:	
		create another class for Circle in new file. radius is private. In Circle class make radius as public data type. 		

	ActivityTwo:

	Ans:1:   A static method is not able to access instance variables or methods.
	Ans:2:	 Yes, a static method can access a non-static variable.


	Errors:	Calling nonstatic method1 in static method. correction: Make method as a static
		create a Circle class and reference it from main as an static and print.

	
	ActivityThree:
		As we already know that primitive types are passed by value, a copy of the type is what exists inside a function.
		 An Object is not copied, a reference to it is passed to the function.


	ActivityFour:
		In this activity two objects are created in which the value of variable creatd in class Circle is changed.
		then in 1st swap1 the values are printed and in swap2 the values are swapped with one an other.
